**Classic-PacMan-Game**
Welcome to the Pac-Man Clone! This project is a Python-based recreation of the classic Pac-Man arcade game using the Pygame library. Relive the excitement of navigating Pac-Man through a maze, eating pellets, and avoiding ghosts in this fun and engaging game.

# Key Features
Classic Gameplay: Move Pac-Man around a grid using mouse movements. Eat yellow pellets to score points and avoid randomly moving ghosts to stay alive.
Scoring System: Collect pellets to increase your score. Each pellet collected adds 10 points.
Ghost AI: Ghosts move randomly around the grid. The game ends if Pac-Man collides with a ghost.
Game Over Screen: Displays a "Game Over" message and the final score when the game ends.

# How to Play
Move Pac-Man: Use your mouse to guide Pac-Man to the pellets.
Collect Pellets: Eat all the pellets on the grid to increase your score.
Avoid Ghosts: Steer clear of the ghosts. If you collide with one, the game will end.
